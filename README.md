# Short Overview

This project is a fork of the original nano-vanity tool used to generate NANO addresses with given prefix.
It is forked and suited for use to generate Meow coin addresses.
If you are looking for NANO address generator tool, visit the original tool creator repository [here](https://github.com/PlasmaPower/nano-vanity)
Main credits for this tool go towards [nano-vanity team](https://github.com/PlasmaPower).

# meow-vanity

Generate a Meow address with a prefix of your choice.
The longer the prefix, the longer it'll take to compute.

## Installation

First, setup Rust. The best way to do this is with [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

To install `meow-vanity` from crates.io:

```
cargo install meow-vanity
```

To install `meow-vanity` from source:

```
cargo install --path .
```

If you want to enable GPU support, install OpenCL and add `--features gpu` to the install command.

For a list of `meow-vanity` options, use `meow-vanity --help`.

## Seed Generation

By default, `meow-vanity` generates private keys instead of seeds.
You can use these in the desktop wallet (they're refered to as adhoc keys),
however, most other wallets do not yet support them.

You can generate seeds instead of private keys with `--generate-seed`.
Note that doing so is a bit slower.

To explain the difference between seeds and private keys:

- Seeds plus an index (1st key, 2nd key, etc) generate a private key.
  Currently, this project will always use the first index (index 0).
- A private key generates a public key.
- Addresses are another way of writing public keys.

## Wildcards

You can leave a character up to chance by using `.` or `*`.

You can specify that a character must be a number with `#`.

## Using your GPU

This project supports using your GPU to compute the address.
This utilizes OpenCL, so you'll need OpenCL installed and working.

To build this project with GPU support, pass cargo `--features gpu`.

To enable GPU use, use the `--gpu` (or `-g`) option. To disable
use of your CPU, use `--threads 0` (or `-t 0`).

Intel GPUs are not supported, as in most cases running the code on
the integrated GPU is no faster than running it on the CPU.

To change your GPU device, use `--gpu-device [index]`, where `[index]`
is the index of your GPU starting at 0.
To change your GPU platform, use `--gpu-platform [index]`.

## Testing randomness

To test the randomness of seeds from this program, you can use dieharder
([here](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4125/)'s an article on it).

Dieharder should not be taken as proof that this program is secure, however, it should be used as evidence, in combination
with an examination of the program's source code.

Here's an example of how to run this with dieharder:

```
meow-vanity --threads 1 --no-progress --limit 0 --simple-output meow_1 | cut -d' ' -f1 | xxd -r -p | dieharder -a -g stdin_input_raw
```

If you get a weak or failed test, run that test again by passing dieharder `-d [test]`.
While it's statistically unlikely that a test would fail despite nothing being wrong, it can happen,
especially given the number of tests dieharder runs.

To be even more careful, you can modify meow-vanity's parameters.
The important ones are `--simple-output`, which makes the output format easily parseable,
and `-l 0`, which generates infinite keys instead of just one.
